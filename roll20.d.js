/**
 * @typedef ChatMessage
 * @property {String} who - The display name of the player or character that sent the message.
 * @property {String} playerID - The ID of the player that sent the message.
 * @property {String} type - One of "general", "rollresult", "gmrollresult", "emote", "whisper", "desc", or "api".
 * @property {String} content - The contents of the chat message. If type is "rollresult", this will be a JSON string 
 * of data about the roll.
 * @property {String} [origRoll] - (type "rollresult" or "gmrollresult" only) The original text of the roll, eg:
 * "2d10+5 fire damage" when the player types "/r 2d10+5 fire damage". This is equivalent to the use of content on
 * messages with types other than "rollresult" or "gmrollresult".
 * @property {String} inlinerolls - (content contains one or more inline rolls only) An array of objects containing
 * information about all inline rolls in the message.
 * @property {String} rolltemplate - (content contains one or more roll templates only) The name of the template
 * specified.
 * @property {String} [target] - (type "whisper" only) The player ID of the person the whisper is sent to. If the
 * whisper was sent to the GM without using his or her display name (ie, "/w gm text" instead of "/w Riley text"
 * when Riley is the GM), or if the whisper was sent to a character without any controlling players, the value will
 * be "gm".
 * @property {String} [target_name] - (type "whisper" only) The display name of the player or character the whisper
 * was sent to.
 * @property {String} [selected] - (type "api" only) An array of objects the user had selected when the command was
 * entered.
 */

/**
 * @function
 * You can use this function to send a chat message.
 * @param {String} speakingAs - Can be one of:
 * - Any string, in which case that will be used as the name of the person who sent the message. E.g. "Riley"
 * - A player's ID, formatted as "player|-Abc123" where "-Abc123" is the ID of the player. If you do this it will
 * automatically use the avatar and name of the player.
 * - A character's ID, formatted as "character|-Abc123". If you do this it will automatically use the avatar and name
 * of the Character.
 * @param {String} input - Should be any valid expression just like the ones used in the Roll20 App. You enter text
 * to send a basic message, or use slash-commands such as "/roll", "/em", "/w", etc. In addition:
 * - You can use Character Attributes with the format \@\{CharacterName|AttributeName\}.
 * - You can use Character Abilities with the format: %\{CharacterName|AbilityName\}.
 * - You cannot use macros.
 * - You can use the `/direct <msg>` command to send a message without any processing (e.g. autolinking of URLs),
 *  and you can use the following HTML tags in the message
 * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional third parameter consisting of a callback function which will be passed
 * the results of the sendChat() call instead of sending the commands to the game. Using sendChat() in this way is
 * asynchronous. The results of the sendChat() command will be an ARRAY of operations, and each individual object
 * will be just like an object you receive during a chat:message event (see above).
 * You can use this, for example, to perform a roll using the Roll20 roll engine, then get the results of the roll
 * immediately. You could then perform additional modifications to the roll before sending it to the players in the
 * game.
 * @param {{noarchive:Boolean, use3d:Boolean}} [options] - An optional fourth parameter to set options for how the
 * message is handled. Options are specified as a javascript object with who's properties are the names of the options
 * to set and whose values are the settings for them, generally true as they default to false.
 * - `noarchive` - Set this to true to prevent the message from being stored in the chat log. This is particularly
 * useful for output that is not part of the story, such as Mod (API) Button menus and state information.
 * - `use3d` - You can now generate 3D Dice rolls using the sendChat() function. The syntax is simply: 
 * ```
 * sendChat("Name", "Rolling [[3d6]]", null, {use3d: true});
 * //If you pass a player ID to the name parameter, such as... 
 * sendChat("player|-ABC123",...)
 * //the player's color will be used for the dice. Otherwise a default white color will be used. 
 * ```

 * abilities belong to characters, graphics, texts, and paths belong to pages, etc.), you must pass in the ID of the
 * parent in the list of properties (for example, you must include the characterid property when creating an
 * attribute). Also note that even when creating new objects, you can't set read-only properties, they will
 * automatically be set to their default value. The one exception to this is when creating a Path, you must include
 * the 'path' property, but it cannot be modified once the path is initially created.
